Bloomberg issued several remarks critical of Donald Trump during his DNC speech, including referring to his candidacy as a “con” and mocking his business acumen, but he did not say the words attributed to him above. A full transcript of Bloomberg’s speech can be found here, while the relevant portion has been reproduced below: Nonetheless, some newspapers misquoted Bloomberg and reported that he had referred to Trump as a “con artist”: It was Florida senator Marco Rubio who referred to Trump (more than once) as a “con artist” during the campaign for the Republican nomination:. arafed man in a suit and tie standing in an office', evidence_image=<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=900x656 at 0x32B746510>, evidence_image_caption='arafed man in a suit and tie standing in an office', classification=None),\n",
       " Evidence(evidence_id='test_4663', evidence=\"\\n  Trump’s former fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen accuses Trump of being a “cheat” – inflating and deflating his net worth to suit his needs.\\n\\n  “It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,” Cohen says in the prepared testimony.\\n\\n  Later during the hearing, Cohen answered “yes” when he was asked if the President or his company ever intentionally inflated assets to get a loan. \\n\\nSEE: Documents Michael Cohen will present to back up his testimony to Congress\\n\\n  As evidence, Cohen offers up three different exhibits, which are essentially back-of-the-envelope general estimations of Trump’s assets and liabilities and a bottom line declaration of his worth. \\n\\n  Cohen suggested they were prepared by Trump and his associates when Trump was trying to secure a loan from Deutsche Bank for an ultimately unsuccessful bid to buy the Buffalo Bills and for Forbes Magazine, which publishes an annual list of billionaires.\\n\\n  “These documents and others were provided to Deutsche Bank in one occasion when I was with them in our attempt to obtain money so that we could put a bid in on the Buffalo Bills,” he said in response to questions.\\n\\n  The one- and two-page documents show Trump claimed his net worth grew from $4.2 billion to $8.7 billion between 2011 and 2013 – a jump that comes from the addition of a line estimating Trump’s “brand value.” \\n\\n  The move appears to have been a way for Trump to puff up his net worth for the benefit of loan officers or magazine factcheckers. But, according to Cohen, Trump was also practiced at making his net worth seem smaller at tax time.\\n\\n  As proof Cohen offered two news articles, one from 2015 in which Forbes said Trump had been inflating his wealth and another, from The Guardian in 2016, on Trump’s long legal effort to slash the value of Trump National Golf Course in Westchester County, New York.\\n\\n  The pattern has also been reported by CNN. In 2017, CNN found that Trump had fought the tax assessments of all 12 of his US golf courses except the one in Bedminster, New Jersey.  That included his Trump National Golf Course Westchester, which Ossining, New York, said was worth $15.1 million, but which Trump, fighting for a smaller tax bill, argued in court the property was worth just $1.5 million. \\n\\nThe 29 most consequential lines from Michael Cohen's congressional testimony\\n\\n  In a 2017 financial disclosure, Trump said the club was worth far more than the $15 million claimed by Ossining. \\n\\n  In his prepared testimony, Cohen also said Trump once bragged of a $10 million tax refund in the depths of the financial crisis just as he was slashing salaries for his employees, including Cohen. \\n\\n  “When telling me in 2008 or 2009 that he was cutting employees’ salaries in half – including mine – he showed me what he claimed was a $10 million IRS tax refund, and he said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving ‘someone like him’ that much money back,” Cohen said in the prepared testimony.\\n\\n  While Cohen didn’t offer proof of his tax claim, The New York Times published documents in 2016 that showed Trump claimed a nearly billion-dollar loss in 1995, which could potentially have shielded him from 18 years of income taxes. But while this offers a snapshot of Trump’s finances, the public still doesn’t know the full picture since he’s steadfastly refused to release his tax returns.\\n\\n  We don’t know everything Trump tells the government about his net worth and his income because he has refused to release his tax returns. \\n\\n  However, we do know he paid some taxes in the intervening decades. A selectively leaked page of Trump’s tax return for 2005 showed he paid $38 million in tax in that year. The White House said the tax was paid on more than $150 million in income that year, which was in the midst of the real estate bubble.\\n\\n  The White House said at the time Trump also made a “large-scale” write-off for construction losses.  \\n\\n  But Trump’s efforts to secure financing to expand his empire paid off. He never bought the Bills, but Trump businesses wound up borrowing over $300 million from Deutsche Bank to pay for a Florida golf course and hotels in Chicago and Washington, according to financial disclosures and public filings from 2012 to 2015, including disclosures Trump filed as a presidential candidate with the Office of Government Ethics. \\n\\n  According to a Bloomberg report, executives at the bank considered extending the repayment several years to 2025, after a potential Trump second term. The New York Times reported Deutsche Bank rejected a loan request from Trump Organization in 2016. Democrats have zeroed in on the loans as an area for investigation. \\n\\n  Trump’s history of borrowing from Deutsche Bank is long, according to an in-depth Wall Street Journal analysis, which also notes he defaulted on more than $300 million in 2008 and sued the bank, claiming the financial crisis was an unforeseen event. They eventually settled out of court.\\n© 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

       " Evidence(evidence_id='test_7100', evidence='\\n  Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s one-time personal attorney and fixer, is testifying before the House Oversight Committee Wednesday – likely the only chance the public will have to hear from him before he is sent to jail in May for a series of tax and campaign finance charges. \\n\\nCohen’s testimony is one of the biggest moments of Trump’s time in office and among the most high-profile hearings on Capitol Hill in modern political memory.\\n\\n  I watched Cohen’s testimony throughout the day, plucked out key lines from him and added context and analysis.  These lines are in the chronological order in which Cohen said them.\\n\\n\\n1. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.”\\n\\n  These lines, from Cohen’s opening statement, set the tone for the day. And the tone is this: Cohen is not going to be pulling any punches on Trump. A man who spent a decade at the right hand of the current President of the United States is now saying on the record that that man is a “racist,” a “conman” and a “cheat.” We’ve grown used to the abnormal in Trump’s White House, but even by that standard, this is a “whoa” moment.\\n\\n2. “He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.”\\n\\n  And boom goes the dynamite. This is a Very Big Deal.  Remember that Trump told The New York Times earlier this year that he had never spoken to Stone – who has been indicted on charges that he lied to Congress about the nature and extent of his dealing with WikiLeaks – about the DNC emails hacked by the Russians and then released to do maximum damage to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. “No, I didn’t. I never did,” Trump said when asked whether he talked to Stone about the stolen emails. The Times also pressed on whether Trump told anyone, including Stone, to get in touch with WikiLeaks to see when they were planning to drop the emails. “Never did,” Trump responded.\\n\\n3. “A copy of a check Mr. Trump wrote from his personal bank account – after he became president – to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign.”\\n\\n  Cohen has the receipts – literally! The check – for $35,000 – is dated August 1, 2017, and signed in Trump’s very distinctive script. That date is, obviously, after Trump became president. And if Cohen is to be believed, it also directly contradicts Trump’s assertions in April 2018 that he knew nothing about where Cohen got the money to keep porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal – both of whom alleged affairs with Trump – quiet during the 2016 campaign.  \\n\\n  Of course, a check signed to Cohen is not proof that the money was a reimbursement for the hush payments – although the check is consistent with Cohen’s version of events and the version of events that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York seem to believe: That Trump played a role in coordinating and orchestrating the payments to Daniels and McDougal in a clear end-run of campaign finance laws.\\n\\n4. “Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates.”\\n\\n  This from Cohen directly disputes reporting from BuzzFeed News that Cohen was instructed to lie by the President. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office released a statement that took issue with the BuzzFeed reporting shortly after it published.\\n\\n5. “There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me ‘How’s it going in Russia?’ – referring to the Moscow Tower project.”\\n\\n  This sheds light on the breadth of Trump’s interest in and conversations about Trump Tower Moscow. What we knew prior to today is that Cohen lied to Congress when he told them that all conversations with the Russians about the development had stopped by January 2016. Cohen later admitted that he had lied about that because he was concerned it might hurt Trump’s presidential chances if people knew that the conversations had continued all the way into the summer of 2016.\\n\\n6. “Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.”\\n\\n  A few things here are relevant. First, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in January that Trump was involved in discussions about the possible Trump Tower Moscow project all the way through the election. (Giuliani later said he was speaking only hypothetically about what Trump knew when.) Second, both that admission from Giuliani and Cohen’s claim seem to directly dispute Trump’s repeated insistence during the campaign that “I have nothing to do with Russia. I don’t have any jobs in Russia. I’m all over the world but we’re not involved in Russia.”\\n\\n7. “Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the ‘greatest infomercial in political history.’”\\n\\n  No matter how Trump tries to rewrite history, it is a fact that he never, ever thought he would be the Republican nominee – much less the president. He had walked up to the edge of running a few times before and knew that if he didn’t do it this time then people wouldn’t cover him when he thought about it in the future. You can dispute Cohen’s assertion that Trump’s entire campaign was solely to further brand awareness, but you cannot dispute that the billionaire businessman never thought he would win.\\n\\n8. “Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of ‘wouldn’t that be great.’”\\n\\n  These lines are probably the most important in all of Cohen’s opening statement – and maybe in his broader daylong testimony. Per No. 2 above, Cohen’s assertion that he was in the room when Trump talked to Stone about WikiLeaks and its plans to release stolen emails runs directly counter to Trump’s public insistence that he had never talked to Stone about WikiLeaks. Directly counter. The timing of all of this is very interesting too. Cohen says in his testimony that the call occurred between Stone and Trump about WikiLeaks in July 2016. Later that month, Trump held a news conference in which he said: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” Either on or right around that day, according to an indictment of a number of Russian officials by Mueller, Russia sent phishing attempts to Clinton staffers. Ahem.\\n\\n9. “He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole.’ This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.”\\n\\n  Impossible to corroborate what Cohen is saying here – unless there were other people in the room – but this is consistent with reporting from CNN and others in January 2018 that Trump referred to immigrants coming into the US from “shithole” countries.\\n\\n10. “He told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.” \\n\\n  Again, virtually impossible to corroborate this. While Trump never said anything like what Cohen alleges in the 2016 campaign, his pitch to black voters was hugely stereotypical – suggesting that they didn’t have much, so why not take a chance on voting for him. “What do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump,” Trump would often ask. “What the hell do you have to lose?”\\n\\n11. “He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did.”\\n\\n  This runs directly counter to Trump’s insistence that he a) knew nothing about the payment to Stormy Daniels  and b) never spoke with Cohen about how to handle that situation. It is also runs counter to Trump’s repeated denials that he ever engaged in extramarital acts with Daniels.\\n\\n12. “This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year – while he was President. The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.”\\n\\n  The check Cohen is referencing – from No. 3 above – could be damning evidence. The problem, of course, is that nowhere on the check does it say that Trump is reimbursing Cohen for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. Which gives Trump plausible deniability. Still, it doesn’t look good. At all.\\n\\n13. “I’m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.”\\n\\n  If you don’t think Cohen is telling the truth here, then you have missed the entirety of Trump’s professional and political life – all of which make Cohen’s claim wholly credible.\\n\\n14. “He finished the conversation with the following comment. ‘You think I’m stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam.’”\\n\\n  Trump received a series of deferments that kept him out of the Vietnam war. He claimed he had a medical condition – bone spurs – that would make him unable to serve. Two daughters of the podiatrist who diagnosed Trump with those bone spurs told The New York Times that their father did so as a “favor” to Trump’s father, Fred.\\n\\n15. “Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not.”\\n\\n  NO COLLUSION!\\n\\n16.  “Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father’s desk – which in itself was unusual. People didn’t just walk behind Mr. Trump’s desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: ‘The meeting is all set.’ I remember Mr. Trump saying, ‘OK good…let me know.’”\\n\\n  This conversation, which Cohen said happened in early June 2016, is what he believes is a sign that President Trump knew about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Don Jr, Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and a group of Russians promising dirt on Clinton. Trump and Trump Jr. have denied that the President ever knew about the meeting. And in their defense, Cohen’s memory is pure conjecture here; Don Jr. could have been talking about any number of meetings and Cohen has no proof that the President’s eldest son was actually looping his father in on the meeting with the Russians.\\n\\n17. “I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump.”\\n\\n  This clears up one question I had coming into this hearing. But Cohen’s statement doesn’t make clear whether a pardon was ever offered – or even floated by Trump or his allies. \\n\\n18. “I did not want to go to the White House. I was offered jobs.”\\n\\n  Cohen pushed back hard on the idea that Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan put forward that Cohen’s willingness to attack Trump was entirely born of his anger that he had not been asked to serve in the White House. Cohen said that Trump wanted him to work in the White House but that he believed it would invalidate their attorney-client privilege and therefore make it impossible to do his other work on behalf of Trump. Donald Trump Jr. disagreed with Cohen’s version of events, tweeting: “Hahahaha Michael Cohen begged to work at the White House and everyone knows it.”\\n\\n19. “[Stone] frequently reached out to Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump was very happy to take his calls. It was – free service.”\\n\\n  This is important. Cohen made clear here that Roger Stone was not an operative of the Trump campaign but rather a sort-of friend who flitted in and out of Trump world.  There was, according to Cohen, no codified relationship between the two  – although Cohen did say Trump was more than happy to take Stone’s call and any information he offered.\\n\\n20. “Mr. Trump’s desire to win would have him work with anyone.”\\n\\n  This was Cohen’s response to Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s question as to whether the President was capable of working with the Russians to help him win an election. This is entirely speculative, of course, but it is worth noting that Cohen did know Trump better than almost anyone for more than a decade.\\n\\n21. “Everything was done with the knowledge of, and at the direction of, Mr. Trump.”\\n\\n  Cohen is speaking specifically here about his allegation that he worked on Trump’s behalf to make him look wealthier in order to boost him on Forbes’ list of the richest people in the country. For what it’s worth, Trump dropped 220 slots on Forbes’ list in 2017. \\n\\n22. “It wasn’t our responsibility to be the fact checker for a news agency.”\\n\\n  Jordan wanted to know why Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, had not denied the BuzzFeed News story last month which, citing informed sources, said that Cohen had told the special counsel’s office that Trump had asked him to lie to Congress. The special counsel’s office did dispute the story – in broad terms – although BuzzFeed did not retract it.  Earlier in his testimony (see No. 5 above) Cohen said under oath that Trump had never directly asked him to lie to Congress.\\n\\n23. “They want to know what I know about Mr. Trump … and not one question has been asked about Mr. Trump.”\\n\\n  After two hours of questioning and a brief break, Cohen used a question from Jordan to lecture Republicans. Cohen noted that Republicans on the Oversight Committee had spent hours forcing him to confess wrongs he had committed, which he had already admitted, rather than asking questions about his dealings with Trump as it related to either the hush payments to Daniels and McDougal or the President’s involvement in the conversations about the Trump Tower Moscow development.\\n\\n  The two sparred several times on Wednesday. In another key moment of the hearing, Cohen said, “shame on you, Mr. Jordan,” when arguing that the congressman had mischaracterized his testimony.\\n\\n24. “I have no reason to believe that tape exists.”\\n\\n  Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland kind of, sort of asked Cohen about whether he was aware – or had ever seen – what has been called the “pee tape,” a rumored video of Trump watching prostitutes urinating at a hotel in Russia. (The allegation was made as part of a broader dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.)  According to former FBI Director James Comey, Trump brought up the tape allegation and asked him to dispute it publicly if he could.\\n\\n25. “He speaks in a code. And I understand the code because I’ve been around him for a decade.”\\n\\n  One of Cohen’s core arguments in his testimony is that Trump never directly told him to, say, lie to Congress because he didn’t have to: Cohen, like others who had spent years with Trump, knew exactly what Trump wanted done. Whether you believe Cohen truly understands the “code” that Trump is speaking in – or whether he is actually speaking in any code at all – depends on how you view Trump (and Cohen). Regardless, it seems clear that Trump did not expressly tell Cohen to break the law, although Cohen has clearly stated in his testimony that Trump sought to end-run campaign finance laws in paying off two women who alleged affairs with Trump in the mid-2000s.\\n\\n26. “I have never been to Prague.”\\n\\n  Well, that settles that. The Steele dossier alleged that Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with a Russian official during the 2016 campaign. Cohen denied he went to Prague, and said he instead went to Europe in 2016 but was in London to visit his daughter, who was studying abroad.\\n\\n27. “I don’t believe Mr. Trump ever struck Mrs. Trump, ever.”\\n\\n  Cohen made this comment in response to questioning by Democratic California Rep. Jackie Speier about the possible existence of an elevator tape from Trump Tower in which Donald Trump is allegedly seen hitting his wife, Melania Trump. “Comedian” Tom Arnold has spread the idea that such an elevator tape exists, while offering no proof of that fact. Cohen said he believes no tape like that exists and that Trump was never violent with his wife.\\n\\n28. “What he didn’t want was to have an entire group of thinks tanks run through his tax return … and then he’ll end up in an audit and eventually have taxable consequences.”\\n\\n  Asked by California Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D) what Trump had told Cohen about why he didn’t want to release his tax returns, Cohen offered up this answer – which is FAR different from the White House’s official line that he cannot release the returns because he is under audit. According to Cohen, Trump was worried about being under audit if his returns were released and picked through. Which would suggest that he is not currently under audit, and that the real reason Trump is afraid of releasing his taxes is because he doesn’t want to pay tax fines.\\n\\n29. “I fear that if he loses the presidential election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”\\n\\n  In Cohen’s closing statement, he offered this ominous warning about what might happen if Trump loses a bid for a second term in 2020. It’s not an idle threat, either. Remember that Trump has argued – with no evidence – that 3 to 5 million votes had been cast illegally in the 2016 election. And that was an election he won! Imagine what it would be like if he lost.\\n© 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

       " Evidence(evidence_id='train_12005', evidence='The billionaire had a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday. Bloomberg gives address after ending campaignFormer New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, a centrist billionaire who launched a White House bid after years of flirting with a run, and pledged to use his vast resources to unite Democrats and moderate Republicans against President Donald Trump has suspended  his campaign and is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden.His campaign was shaken by Biden’s resurgence and overwhelming victory in the South Carolina primary, which reignited the former vice president\\'s bid and led other moderate candidates to drop out of the race end endorse him in an effort to consolidate the primary vote and prevent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders from clinching the party’s nomination. By Super Tuesday, it was clear that Bloomberg\\'s efforts to target the 15 contests in play in lieu of traditional campaigning methods of hitting the early voting states simply did not pay off in terms of netting the bulk of pledged delegates or the popular vote.“Three months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump – because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult,\" he wrote in a letter to supporters adding “I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.\"Biden, who has acknowledged his lackluster ground game, told ABC News that changes were coming to his campaign in terms of staffing. On Wednesday, he tweeted his thanks to Bloomberg whose endorsement could possibly help strengthen the former vice president\\'s bid with a potential huge influx of cash and organization assistance.\"@MikeBloomberg, I can’t thank you enough for your support—and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It’s about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we’re gonna do it,” Biden tweeted.Despite ruling out a White House run last spring, Bloomberg reversed course in the fall and entered the race just before Thanksgiving, offering himself as a pragmatic problem solver with unlimited resources who could appeal to the middle of the country alienated by Trump and leading progressives, at a moment when former vice president Joe Biden faced questions about the strength of his campaign.Bloomberg’s campaign surged after Biden’s disastrous fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, impressing voters and Democratic officials with the size and scale of his operation despite skipping the first four early primary contests, and seizing on concerns that Sanders’ nomination could endanger down-ballot Democrats across the country this fall.\"Defeating Trump – and rebuilding America – is the most urgent and important fight of our lives. And I’m going all in,” Bloomberg said on his website at the time.In the first 100 days of his campaign, Bloomberg spent more than half a billion dollars of his estimated $60 billion fortune on his campaign, flooding airwaves around the country with ads, opening hundreds of offices across the country, and hiring more than 2,100 people to his team, building an operation from scratch that resembled a general election operation more than a primary campaign.His was a novel gambit: throwing out the traditional primary rulebook altogether, bypassing the four early states altogether and focusing in on delegate-rich Super Tuesday spots like Texas, California and Florida. Moreover, he specifically homed in on the swing states Trump picked up in 2016 that Democrats “should” have won, like Ohio or Michigan.Bloomberg’s energetic efforts at outreach demonstrate an immense appetite for seeking voters where they live, and showing his commitment, especially visiting those areas off the beaten campaign trail during the early primary stages; as other candidates campaigned in Iowa with a weather eye towards March - Bloomberg was already all over the map.Moreover, he swiftly assembled a formidable ground game: field staff swelling to over 2,000 in 43 states and territories, including all Super Tuesday states; more than 400 in their headquarters.On his massive operation, Bloomberg called it an “investment” in beating Trump.“Some of these candidates criticize me for spending a lot of money,” Bloomberg said at a December stump stop in Ohio. “I think “you want me to spend less to get rid of Donald Trump? I don’t think so.”Bloomberg’s campaign has said it would “spend whatever it takes” to remove Trump from office; he has left open the possibility that he could eventually put as much as a billion dollars into the race - even if it\\'s not his to run - pledging to keep his operation open even if he is not the nominee - to help whoever does eventually win.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said he would refuse Bloomberg’s help, should he win the nomination; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., though she said she’d accept Bloomberg’s aid, also did not hold back: in turns accusing him of “buying his way” into the election, and that he was “skipping the democracy part” of the primary.He faced sharp rebuke from rivals who criticized his large ad buys and campaign strategy.Despite slick commercials that portrayed Bloomberg as an effective and decisive manager who rebuilt New York City after the September 11th terror attacks, Bloomberg, an uneven debater and retail politician, never recovered from a poor showing in his first primary debate, when he struggled to respond to attacks about his past as a Republican, his wealth and a series of nondisclosure agreements related to alleged comments towards women at his company, along with the controversial stop-and-frisk policing tactics used in the city during his tenure.Just before announcing his 2020 bid, Bloomberg made a very public apology for his support of stop and frisk - and continued to do so over the course of his campaign, touring through black and brown communities, meeting with leaders, and rolling out several criminal justice and economic policies specifically geared towards lifting up those communities most hurt by such divisive issues.His past treatment of women in his employ, as well as the culture at his eponymous company, has also faced intense scrutiny. ABC News’ breaking investigation in December explored the repeated occasions where Bloomberg had faced and fought allegations that he directed crude and sexist comments to women in his office,  including a claim in the 1990s that he told an employee who had just announced she was pregnant to \"kill it.\" Bloomberg has repeatedly denied making these and other comments.The nondisclosure agreements he has kept with many of his employees keep any of those on the receiving end of these comments from sharing their side. On the debate stage, Warren tore into Bloomberg, demanding as she had told ABC News for months that he release the women from their secrecy agreements.For his part, Bloomberg just days later announced that he would release three of those signatories from their agreement.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. arafed image of a man walking on stage with a flag in the background', evidence_image=<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=992x558 at 0x30F257CD0>, evidence_image_caption='arafed image of a man walking on stage with a flag in the background', classification=None),\n",

Now, if you squint, you can see the light at the end of the shutdown\\'s long tunnel.Trump won\\'t admit to having backed down, but rescheduling the State of the Union and now reconsidering a stopgap spending measure to fund the government, mark strategic shifts by the White House that reflect Washington\\'s new realities.It may have taken doses of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Lara Trump to provide some color, but the writing has been on the wall for days, if not weeks. The shutdown Trump said he would own has proven to be bad politics, in service of policies the public was never really on board for.House Democrats are expected to put forward their border-security package soon, knowing that over in the GOP-controlled Senate, more Republicans broke Thursday to support the Democratic package than the competing proposal from the White House.As Trump\\'s concessions make clear, divided government means diminished possibilities for the president. As the race to replace him heats up, Democrats have made their presence known and then some.The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice ParksBoth former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg found themselves defending and answering this week for old tendencies of theirs to work across the aisle, have friends in both parties and get on board with more moderate, or even conservative, approaches to problems.Neither has said definitively whether they are running for president, though they\\'d each change the field considerably and instantly by jumping in.Both Bloomberg and Biden have been touring and giving speeches. The two men even spoke in Washington at the same Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast.\"Whatever the next year brings for Joe and me ... I know we\\'ll both keep our eyes on the real prize, and that is electing a Democrat to the White House in 2020, and getting our country back on track,\" Bloomberg said.Their past practices might make the two politicians particularly appealing to a general election audience, but the primary comes first. A willingness to play nice and compromise is feeling ever more foreign in a party lurching towards resistance.The TIP with Rachel ScottAs the campaign to run against Trump has begun, Republican leaders showed division on their strategy for supporting the president.Meeting in New Mexico this week, Republican National Committee members were moving forward with an unprecedented pledge to give Trump their \"undivided support.\" But the party stopped short of considering a resolution that would endorse the president as the party nominee in 2020.One resolution backed by RNC member Jevon Williams looked to change the rules to prevent a GOP primary challenger. According to a photo on Williams\\' twitter account, Trump wrote to Williams thanking him for his support, but RNC members did not consider his resolution. Instead, they decided to move forward with an alternative submission that vowed its \"undivided support\" for Trump and his presidency.\"The members just wanted to underscore, underline, highlight that we are here to re-elect President Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot,\" the RNC\\'s national press secretary Cassie Smedile said.Now that the resolution has passed in the committee, all 168 members of the RNC will vote on it Friday. It\\'s an interesting move for the party, which is looking to stand firm behind the president as the country continues to feel the effects of the government shutdown and amid growing concern over the special counsel\\'s investigation.

Sengar, 52, is also accused of raping the girl in 2017.“So far as the movement of victim and lawyer for medical treatment is concerned there appears to be hesitation on the part of the family members, so we shall defer giving orders to Monday,” the top court said.Also read: Lawyer wrote to authorities about threats: Unnao rape survivor’s relativeThe survivor’s lawyer earlier told the court that the mother was of the view that for the present the survivor should remain in the hospital since she was unconscious. But the mother wanted to reserve the right to seek her shifting outside Lucknow. “Mother says the doctors must at least provide her with a daily medical bulletin,” the lawyer said.Both the survivor and the lawyer’s kin, however, sought daily health bulletins from Lucknow’s KGMU hospital, where the two are being treated.The top court also ordered that the survivor’s uncle, who is in Rae Bareli jail in a two-decade old attempt to murder case, be shifted to Delhi’s Tihar and sought a compliance report by the state on Monday. The counsel of the Uttar Pradesh government, earlier, contended that the survivor’s uncle was safe and secure in Rae Bareli jail and that the state had no objection if the court wanted to move him.The four-time lawmaker, Sengar is accused of raping the girl when she went to meet him along with a neighbour to seek his help in getting a job in June 2017.This was followed by two years of ordeal that saw the girl going missing for almost 10 days, accusing police of not letting her name the MLA in her complaint, her father being beaten up and dying in custody and a key witness dying in 2018.The case was finally handed over to the CBI in 2018 and it booked Sengar, his brother and five others in the case.In the past few weeks, preceding the rape survivor’s road accident, she and her family had written several letters to the police, CBI, government officials and the CJI alleging threat to life from the MLA. They accused the MLA and his henchmen of intimidating them and asking them to withdraw the case.Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations. a close up of a man in a white shirt with his arms crossed\n",

       " Evidence(evidence_id='5443', evidence='The Supreme Court on Friday deferred shifting of the Unnao rape survivor, injured in an accident last week, to a hospital in Delhi while ordering that her uncle be shifted from a Rae Bareli jail to Tihar in the national capital.The survivor and her lawyer were critically injured, while her two aunts died, in an accident that is now being probed by the CBI as the kin had alleged that BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar was behind the conspiracy to kill the girl. Sengar, 52, is also accused of raping the girl in 2017.“So far as the movement of victim and lawyer for medical treatment is concerned there appears to be hesitation on the part of the family members, so we shall defer giving orders to Monday,” the top court said.Also read: Lawyer wrote to authorities about threats: Unnao rape survivor’s relativeThe survivor’s lawyer earlier told the court that the mother was of the view that for the present the survivor should remain in the hospital since she was unconscious. But the mother wanted to reserve the right to seek her shifting outside Lucknow. “Mother says the doctors must at least provide her with a daily medical bulletin,” the lawyer said.Both the survivor and the lawyer’s kin, however, sought daily health bulletins from Lucknow’s KGMU hospital, where the two are being treated.The top court also ordered that the survivor’s uncle, who is in Rae Bareli jail in a two-decade old attempt to murder case, be shifted to Delhi’s Tihar and sought a compliance report by the state on Monday. The counsel of the Uttar Pradesh government, earlier, contended that the survivor’s uncle was safe and secure in Rae Bareli jail and that the state had no objection if the court wanted to move him.The four-time lawmaker, Sengar is accused of raping the girl when she went to meet him along with a neighbour to seek his help in getting a job in June 2017.This was followed by two years of ordeal that saw the girl going missing for almost 10 days, accusing police of not letting her name the MLA in her complaint, her father being beaten up and dying in custody and a key witness dying in 2018.The case was finally handed over to the CBI in 2018 and it booked Sengar, his brother and five others in the case.In the past few weeks, preceding the rape survivor’s road accident, she and her family had written several letters to the police, CBI, government officials and the CJI alleging threat to life from the MLA. They accused the MLA and his henchmen of intimidating them and asking them to withdraw the case.Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations. a close up of a man in a white shirt with his arms crossed', evidence_image=<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1024x576 at 0x3326FDA10>, evidence_image_caption='a close up of a man in a white shirt with his arms crossed', classification=None)]"
